# cis133-resources
A resource that I found quite helpful on css and html is actually a
youtube video. I find it easier to learn while listening and watching what someone is doing rather than just reading. I also like that I can replay or go back immediately if I didn't really understand something. Its also helpful that they provide time stamps in the description of the video for when I need to go back and review certain parts that I might be struggling on.
